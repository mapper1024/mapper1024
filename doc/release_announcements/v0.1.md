Hello!

I'm happy to give you the first working, testable version of my map making tool designed for authors and storytellers.

You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options
You can use the online demo here: https://mapper1024.github.io/demo

Quickstart
----------
Using the [download](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options) link, you can choose an option for your computer. If you can't or don't want to download the program, just use the [online demo](https://mapper1024.github.io/demo) (currently the live demo works best in Chrome or Edge, Firefox struggles). You do need a computer for this, mobile devices are not yet supported.

When you first run the mapping tool, it will load the sample map. You can play around with the sample map, or make your own maps (*Ctrl+N* in the app, or *Shift+N* in the live demo). All the controls are displayed in the top left corner of the program for now, so you can look there to see what actions you can take.

The most basic controls:
* To add stuff to the map: *left-click* and drag.
* To change what you're adding to the map, hold *W* and *scroll* the mouse wheel.
* To move around the map: *right-click* and drag.
* To zoom in or out: *scroll* the mouse wheel.

If you want to delete stuff from the map, press *D* to switch to the delete brush and just *left-click* and drag.
If you want to go back to adding stuff to the map, press *A*.

In this prototype version of the program you can put forests, grasslands, bodies of water, rocky terrain, roadways, and representations of buildings on the map. Change what you are placing by holding *W* and *scrolling* the mouse wheel.

If you are using the desktop app, you can save your map with *Ctrl+S*, or you can load a saved map with *Ctrl+O*.
