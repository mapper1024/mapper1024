Hello!

I'm happy to give you the first testable version of my map making tool.

You can download it here: https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options

[![A screenshot of the sample map in the mapping tool](https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_2022_07_30.thumb.png)](https://mapper1024.github.io/screenshots/sample_map_2022_07_30.png)

Quickstart
-------
Using the [download](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options) link, you can choose an option for your system. If you can't or don't want to download the program, just use the [online demo](https://mapper1024.github.io/demo).

When you first run the mapping tool, it will load the sample map.
