# Usecase: Roleplayer
This usecase is an extension of the Author usecase, and speciallized features for this usecase are of lower priority, but the mapper should be at least extendable to support this usecase fully.

The mapper should be extendable to support common roleplayer activities including moving tokens around the world to keep track of things.
The mapper should be extendable to support rendering the map from varying points of view---rendering only what is known to an entity, or only what is relevant.
