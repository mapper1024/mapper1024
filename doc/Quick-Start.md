# Welcome to the map-making tool!
This tool is built for authors, storytellers, role-players, and anyone else who wants to make a map to organize or illustrate their worlds with minimal effort.

## Getting started
First you need to get the mapping tool. There are two options: [download the app](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options) or use the [online demo](https://mapper1024.github.io/demo). The app is the recommended option, you can install it on Windows or Linux.

So, before we go any further, [download and install the app](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options). The quick-start guide will assume you are using the app, but most instructions will apply even if you are using the online demo.

## Starting the program

Once you've downloaded and installed the program [according to the instructions](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options), you can launch it directly if you've chosen the direct download, or you can find it in your list of programs or start menu if you've chosen to install it. Launch the program and you'll be met with the sample map that comes with the program.

## Figuring out what things do

Every map control is in the sidebar on the side, and if you hover your mouse over the control you can see a short description of what it does and what its keyboard shortcut is. This guide will refer primarily to controls on the sidebar, but you can use keyboard shortcuts if you prefer.

## Navigating around the map

There are a few tools for navigating around the map: you can zoom in and out, and you can *pan* (slide) the map around to view different places.

### Panning

You can pan around the map by pressing any of the arrow keys or by right-clicking on the map and dragging it to where you want.

### Zooming

There are a lot of zooming options so that you can work on exactly the scale you want.

Most simply, you can just scroll to zoom in or out. You can also hold the *Control* key and press *+* or *-* to zoom in or out.

The zoom panel in the sidebar gives you fine control over map scale so you can ensure your map is accurate.

You can set the zoom level directly, or you can set the scale of the map in terms of kilometers from one corner of the screen to the other diagonally.

## Adding a new lake

Now it's time to edit the map. Go back to the main island and click on the *water* terrain in the sidebar. then click on the map and drag to fill in an area with water, making a lake. You can increase or decrease the brush radius using the sidebar brush radius controls to make your lake the exact shape you want.

## Adding an island

Next, select the *grass* terrain and add an island of grass in the middle of the lake. You'll want to reduce the brush radius so that the island isn't bigger than the lake! You can zoom in a little to make it easier to place the terrain.

## Adding an island fort

You can complete your island with a fort. Under the *buildings* terrain you can find the *castle* object. Place it on the map by clicking where you want it to go after you've selected it in the sidebar. Make your brush small enough that it actually makes sense!

## Naming your island fort

Your fort needs a name and a label so we know what fort it is! To set an object's name, choose the *select* brush from the sidebar. Then click on the castle you just added. In the sidebar, a textbox will appear where you can enter the name of the fort. Set a suitable name and press the save button. The label will appear over the castle on your map.

## Deleting your mistakes

What if you didn't want the fort? Delete it by selecting the *delete* brush from the sidebar and clicking the fort while holding the *Shift* key. This will delete the entire fort.

## Undoing and redoing

Let's say you didn't want to delete the fort. Easy, just undo it! Press the *undo* button in the sidebar, or hold the *Control* key and press *z*.

If you decide you did want to delete the fort after all, just press the *redo* button in the sidebar, or hold the *Control* key and press *y*.

## Creating your own map

Once you're tired of playing with the sample map, create your own! Up near the top of the sidebar you can find the *new map* button. Press it to create a new map.

You can start from scratch, and create any map you want.

## Saving and loading your map

You can save your map to a file and then load it later. To save your map, click on the *save* button near the top of the sidebar. You can select where to put your map on your computer.

Later, you can open the mapping tool again and press the *open* button near the top of the sidebar, and find the map file that you saved earlier. Your map will still be there, ready for more editing!

## Exporting part of your map as an image

Maybe you want part of your map as an illustration, or an image on your blog. It's easy to export part of your map to a PNG image file. Just click on *Export as image* in the sidebar and the mapping tool will enter export mode.

![Export mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/master/diagrams/quickstart/export.png)

You can zoom and pan to get the perfect shot, then click and drag on the map to select an area to export. Once you have an area selected, you can see how big the image will be in the sidebar. When you're satisfied, click on the *Export* button in the sidebar to download the exported image.
