# Welcome to the map-making tool!
This tool is built for authors, storytellers, role-players, and anyone else who wants to make a map to organize or illustrate their worlds with minimal effort.

## Getting started
First you need to get the mapping tool. There are two options: [download the app](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options) or use the [online demo](https://mapper1024.github.io/demo). The app is the recommended option, you can install it on Windows or Linux.

So, before we go any further, [download and install the app](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options). The quick-start guide will assume you are using the app, but most instructions will apply even if you are using the online demo.

## Starting the program

Once you've downloaded and installed the program [according to the instructions](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options), you can launch it directly if you've chosen the direct download, or you can find it in your list of programs or start menu if you've chosen to install it. Launch the program and you'll be met with the sample map that comes with the program.
