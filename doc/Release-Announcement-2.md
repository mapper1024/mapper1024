What's New
----------
Version 0.3 of the map making tool includes the following updates:

* Brush palette --- you can select terrain, brush, brush size, and more with only your mouse or touchpad. Good news for laptop users!
* Smoother graphics --- still in prototype stage, but better transitions.
* Political border support --- imaginary boundaries now have a real presence on the map.
* Prototype map annotation support --- mark areas important to your story.
* Specific objects support --- you can draw a single tree or a lone tower on the map, for example.
* Paths --- Draw paths on your map to indicate shipping routes or forest trails.
* Distance measurement --- Figure out how many kilometers are between two points on the map.
