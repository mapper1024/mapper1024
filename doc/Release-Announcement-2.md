Hello all!

The next major version of my map making tool is released!

You can download it here: [https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options](https://github.com/mapper1024/mapper1024/blob/master/DOWNLOAD.md#download-options)

You can use the online demo here: [https://mapper1024.github.io/demo](https://mapper1024.github.io/demo)

What's New?
-----------
Version 0.3 of the map making tool includes the following updates:

* Brush palette --- you can select terrain, brush, brush size, and more with only your mouse or touchpad. Good news for laptop users!
* Smoother graphics --- still in prototype stage, but better transitions.
* Political border support --- imaginary boundaries now have a real presence on the map.
* Prototype map annotation support --- mark areas important to your story.
* Specific objects support --- you can draw a single tree or a lone tower on the map, for example.
* Paths --- Draw paths on your map to indicate shipping routes or forest trails.
* Distance measurement --- Figure out how many kilometers are between two points on the map.

Survey
---------
Your feedback is important for improving the mapping tool. All the core features are in the prototype now, so I have written a survey for your feedback.

Once you've tested the new version of the mapping tool, you can fill out the survey at **SURVEY HERE** to give important feedback for furthering development. Future versions will use a similar survey to measure satisfaction with the development process.

What's Next?
------------
With all the core features in place, I can focus on refining the user interface and performance according to the feedback given in the survey and elsewhere.

Planned improvements include:

* Improved graphics for a cleaner and more realistic map
* Better performance for a smoother experience
* Full palette menu system to easily select what you want to do
