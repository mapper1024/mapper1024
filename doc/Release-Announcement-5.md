Picture and Performance
---------
Version 0.6 brings great performance improvements--far less jerking the map around--as well as a tuned-up graphics set with better looking forests, lakes, cities, grasslands, and more.

New features and fixes include:

- The ability to extend and merge existing map objects.
- Huge performance improvements by reducing calculations while you're drawing on or panning over the map.
- Greatly improved graphics: terrain is varied and pops out for clarity.

The Final Stretch
--------
Every main feature is now implemented. Performance tuning, testing, and graphical improvements are the primary concerns now: tweaking and optimizing the mapping tool for your satisfaction. As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and feedback!
