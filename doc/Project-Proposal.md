# Project Proposal: Mapping Tool
## Benjamin Leskey
### Purpose and Scope
The mapping tool software is for lay users such as authors, storytellers, and role-playing gamers to create maps for their worlds or fictional environments. It is intended for use as desktop software or a web app in a desktop environment; as well as being used as an embedded component in other web apps. This project will develop a fully functional release of the software through incremental development. As part of the Honors division of this project, a group of testers will receive incremental releases to give feedback on as major milestones are developed: the software is developed for myself, them, and anyone else who may find the tool useful. After the supervised project period is over, this project may be released to the public as open source software.

### Functional Description
The mapping tool software will allow users (e.g. authors or other storytellers) to create custom (e.g. fictional) maps for their worlds or environments. These maps may be used to organize world-building, create book illustrations, or showcase a story, to list a few possibilities.

The mapping tool will allow users to draw maps at a higher level than simply placing pre-made props or drawing pixels. Users can place map objects like a river, a forest, a castle, or an island with specified dimensions without concerning themselves about how specifically the object will look on the screen. The software will provide controls so that the user can edit the map and objects on the map in real dimensions (e.g. meters).

The mapping tool will allow users to render/print their maps to images in pretty format suitable as an illustration or display of a fictional world.

The primary use of the mapping tool is as desktop software (either running locally or in a browser) where the user uses the mouse and keyboard to create and edit their maps, which are saved as files.
The mapping tool may be used as a component in a web app, where the backend that stores the map data is defined by the surrounding system allowing for, e.g., remote storage or collaborative editing.
The mapping tool will support pluggable renderer components, so that the same map may be rendered in different styles (e.g. like a Tolkien map, or like a geographical survey).

### Constraints
A usable, minimal prototype has been developed in the Honors part of this project, and has been released to the testing group. Subsequent releases will also be distributed to the testing group, so incremental development must maintain a functional system after each development cycle. The mapping tool should complete all core requirements to satisfy the testing group; their requirements are being gathered and will be organized to verify what needs to be completed.
